# Keratocyte Galvanotaxis — Data, Sims, and Visuals
Keratocytes migrate directionally in weak electric fields (**galvanotaxis**).  
This repository contains the datasets, simulation code, and animated visuals used to model
cell orientation dynamics and migratory drift on flat substrates. It accompanies my Soft Matter
paper (add full citation and DOI below).

## What’s inside
Reproducible simulations for keratocyte motion under DC fields
Animated GIFs and figures illustrating orientation dynamics and paths
Analysis notebooks for parameter fits, calibration curves, and ablations
Minimal CLI to reproduce main figures
